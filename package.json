  "description": "The Kite Publisher Javascript plugin lets you add one-click trade buttons to your webpage. It works like a basket combined with a payment gateway, where an inline popup opens on your webpage, guides the user through a trade, and lands the user back on your page. As described in the offsite order execution section, it is possible to capture the request_token from this flow to start a Kite Connect session as well.\nYou can add one or more stocks to the basket (maximum 10) dynamically using the Javascript plugin, or embed simple static buttons using plain HTML.",
